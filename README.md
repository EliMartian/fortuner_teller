Fortune Teller Independent Project

Note that the associated .js files were removed, but could easily be regenerated using the TypeScript compiler.

This is all my own original work and passion project. 

## Inspiration
* Want to allow investors to have greater control over visualizing how their investment scales over customized amounts of time and money.
* X amount of $ Y years ago in Z stock is a popular topic in news… why? Curiosity. 
* Nobody can predict the future, but we can use past data to make inferences about the future
* Build security research tools that currently do not exist on any brokerage platform

## Why do Customers need this?
* Solves X amount of $ Y years ago problem 
* Offers an updated Buy / No Buy recommendation with reasoning
* Visualizes hidden trends with year over year performance vs market
* Build stocks / portfolios, see their performance in past, send to friends + family
* Hold “fictional securities” as a fake cost basis to become comfortable investing in the market

## Fortune Teller is NOT:
* A get rich quick scheme 
* Predicting what the stock price will be in the future
* Trying to time the market (promotes time in the market through doing your research and understanding trends of a stock) 
* An absolute must buy or don’t buy recommendation
